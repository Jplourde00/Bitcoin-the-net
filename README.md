# Bitcoin the Network 🌐

> An introduction to Bitcoin: what it is, what it solves, and why we need it.

## 🔍 What Is Bitcoin?

Bitcoin is a **peer-to-peer, decentralized money network** designed to solve a fundamental problem:  
> "How can we transfer value over the internet **without trusting a third party**?"

Launched in 2009 by the pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin allows anyone to send money anywhere, without asking for permission or relying on banks.

## 💥 What Problem Does Bitcoin Solve?

### 🧱 The Double-Spend Problem
Before Bitcoin, digital money could be **copied**, meaning you'd need a central authority (like a bank) to verify transactions.

Bitcoin solved this with:
- A **public blockchain** (an open ledger)
- A **decentralized consensus system**
- A network of nodes that all agree on the history of transactions

### 💸 Broken Money (Why We Need Bitcoin)

- Fiat money is **inflationary**, manipulated by governments.
- Banks are **gatekeepers**, they can freeze accounts or block payments.
- Privacy is **eroded**—banks track everything.
- Billions are **unbanked**.

Bitcoin gives us:
- 🔐 **Control** over our own money  
- 🌍 **Access** to global financial tools  
- ⛓ **Security** backed by proof-of-work  
- 🧾 **Transparency** without third parties

## 🧠 How It Works (High-Level)

- **Miners** compete to add new blocks to the chain (every ~10 minutes)
- **Nodes** verify every transaction and block
- **Mempool** holds unconfirmed transactions
- **Proof-of-Work** ensures consensus and security
- **The Blockchain** is a public, append-only ledger
